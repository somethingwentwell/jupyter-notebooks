    " Q6 : Regarding the exemption criteria as set out in paragraph 4.4.3.2 of the Guidelines on Competence, to what extent will an applicant’s activities be considered as “limited scope”?\n",
    " A: Examples of applicants’ involvement in “limited scope of activities” include:\n",
    "1. Regional Research Head coming to Hong Kong occasionally and is accompanied by other local licensed staff in client meetings, or\n",
    "2. persons only providing technical advice to clients on the structuring of corporate finance deals. The above examples are not intended to be exhaustive.\n",

    " A: The requirement is five CPT hours per regulated activity for each year of absence. In this case, the former practitioner would have to complete 25 CPT hours for each applicable regulated activity (any fraction of a year would be rounded up for this purpose). The former practitioner should complete the required 25 CPT hours before lodging the application.\n",

    "To be eligible for the LRP4 exemptions in paragraph 4.4.3 of the Guidelines on Competence, the additional CPT hours to be taken should be in local regulatory knowledge in respect of the regulated activity applied for.\n",
    "The additional CPT hours may either be taken: (1) within 6 months preceding the application, or (2) within 12 months after the approval is granted. For (1), both the applicant and the sponsoring corporation should provide confirmation that the applicant has already completed the required CPT hours; for (2), both the applicant and the sponsoring corporation should provide undertakings to this effect.\n",

    " A:\n",
    " Q12 : An applicant is currently licensed for Type 1 regulated activity. The applicant took HKSI5 LE6 Paper 1 before being licensed 4 years ago. Will the applicant be required to re-take Paper 1 before applying to additionally engage in Type 2 regulated activity?\n",
    " A: To apply for another type of regulated activity, the applicant should have passed the LRPs required for the new type of regulated activity.\n",
    "Generally, applicants should pass the LRPs within three years preceding the application (see paragraph 4.1.5 of the Guidelines on Competence). However, the SFC may also recognise LRPs obtained more than three years ago if the applicant is a current licensee or has been licensed by the SFC within the past three years (see paragraph 4.1.6 of the Guidelines on Competence). In the above example, the applicant will not be required to re-take HKSI LE Paper 1 even if the exam was taken more than three years ago.\n",
    "In the event that the applicant has never passed the LRPs required for the new type of regulated activity (e.g. the applicant was migrated to the Securities and Futures Ordinance regime by way of transitional arrangements and has never attempted HKSI LE Paper 1), the applicant will not be eligible for an LRP full exemption, but may apply for an appropriate conditional exemption (e.g. LRP Conditional Exemption 6 under paragraph 4.4.3.7 of the Guidelines on Competence) if the relevant eligibility criteria is satisfied.\n",

    " Q14 : An applicant was last licensed on 30 June 2020 under Option 3 of the Guidelines on Competence (March 2003 version) and has left the industry since then. The applicant now rejoins the industry and applies for a new licence. Will the applicant be required to meet the academic qualification requirements under the Guidelines on Competence?\n",
    " A: No. Applicants who previously qualify under Option 3 and have been a licensee before 1 January 2022 may be grandfathered under paragraph 4.2.1.3 (for RO7) or 4.3.1.3 (for LR8) of the Guidelines on Competence, provided that they satisfy the other competence requirements stated therein, such as having recent and relevant industry experience, and meeting the RIQ and LRP requirements as applicable.\n",
    "The grandfathering arrangement would also apply to situations where these applicants apply for addition of regulated activity or approval as RO.\n",
    " Q15 : Under paragraph 4.1.10 of the Guidelines on Competence, the SFC may consider an applicant’s overall career history within the industry in totality. Does this mean an applicant need not accumulate industry experience within the period prescribed in paragraph 4.2.1.2 (for RO) or 4.3.1.2 (for LR)?\n",
    " A: “Recency” is a key element to demonstrate that an applicant is on top of market developments and familiar with the regulatory landscape. While we may consider an applicant’s overall career history within the industry in totality on a case-by-case basis as mentioned in paragraphs 4.1.10 and 4.1.11 of the Guidelines on Competence, this approach mainly covers dated experience for applicants who cannot entirely satisfy the recency test.\n",
    "For example, if an applicant will be assuming the role of the Manager-In-Charge of the Overall Management Oversight function and has not accumulated sufficient relevant industry experience entirely within the prescribed period, we will holistically take into account how the dated experience is relevant to the applicant’s proposed duties, and whether, for example, sufficient infrastructure and human resources are available to the applicant’s proposed accredited principal. If we accept the relevancy of the dated experience, the applicant may be granted a licence subject to licensing conditions.\n",
    "  Q16 : What kind of “management experience” would the SFC consider as relevant for an RO application?\n",
    "A: We consider that “management experience” should refer to the hands-on experience in supervising and managing essential regulated functions or projects in a business setting, including the management of staff engaging in these functions or projects.\n",
    "This may include –\n",
    "1. experience as senior management (e.g. Chief Executive, Business Head or Chief Operating Officer) of a licensed corporation, registered institution or a corporation within the financial industry supervising the performance of regulated activities or financial services;\n",
    "2. experience in supervising an investment team in the performance of an investment function, whether regulated or not; or\n",
    " 3. experience acquired from managing another type of regulated activity.\n",

    "Q17 : Can an LR applicant who is experienced in the private fund management industry apply for LRP Conditional Exemption 4 under the Guidelines on Competence?\n",
    "A: Yes. In line with the SFC’s risk-based and pragmatic licensing approach, we will consider granting conditional exemption to an LR applicant if he or she satisfies the criteria set out in paragraph 4.4.3.5 (a) to (c) of the Guidelines on Competence.\n",
    "1 “Guidelines on Competence” means Guidelines on Competence (January 2022 version). 2 “CPT” means continuous professional training.\n",

    "A1 What is personal data?\n",
    "Personal data is recorded information, including expressions of opinion, relating to an identifiable living individual, which are organised such that they can be processed or retrieved. Examples of personal data used in everyday life include a person's name, telephone number, fax number, address, sex, age, occupation, marital status, salary and financial status, religious belief, nationality, photo, identity card number, medical records and employment records, including assessments of employment performance.\n",

    "A4 Are my rights relating to personal data protected in every sphere of life?\n",
    "Basically yes, but there are certain exemptions from specific provisions of the Ordinance.. These have been provided for in order to maintain the convenience of everyday life and uphold certain social and public interests. One area of exemption relates to personal data held for domestic or recreational purposes. These are generally exempted from the requirements of the Ordinance.\n",
    "To protect the public interest in such matters as security, defence, prevention or detection of crime, assessment or collection of tax, news activities and health, there are exemptions for data users from the requirements to grant access to individuals to their personal records and to limit the use of personal records to the original purpose at the time of the collection of information.\n",
    "For employment-related records, there are certain limited exemptions from the requirement to comply with access requests from individuals. For example, some employment-related personal information held before came into effect is exempt from such access until 2002.\n",
    "A5 Does the Ordinance cover private and public sector organisations, including Government departments?\n",
    " Yes, the Ordinance covers private sector and public sector, including Government departments. The Commissioner can carry out investigations in relation to data users in these sectors.\n",
